# HTD
An implementation of the STL, but with some added, and removed features. I hope to expand it much farther.

## Why?
Learning is cool. Trying to implement some of the structures in the STL has a great learning experience attached to it. Maybe at some point, this project will have more meaning.

## Who?
Right now, with the guidance from the kind folks at the [#learnprogramming](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=learnprogramming) and [#C++-general](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=C++-general) IRC channels, and [Joshua Fixelle](https://github.com/vasimr), I am able to put this all together.

## Helping
I plan to work on this on my own for the time being, but if for some reason, you are reading this random repository, and want to contribute, making an issuing reporting suggestions or errors would be of great help.

## What's next
- [x] String
- [ ] List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Extensions on String, List, and Stack
- [ ] Vector
- [ ] ???
